# Newport Data Project Guides

This is a collection of how-tos, demos, examples, and tutorials that should help you jump into some of our [code-based projects](https://github.com/NewportDataProject). We'll point you towards existing tutorials that we find useful, and we'll lay out our own examples where it makes sense. And, like every part of the Newport Data Project, these guides are community supported, so pitch in where you can.

## Getting Started

We use [GitHub](https://github.com) for a lot on the Newport Data Project (including hosting this website). The cool cats at GitHub have [this nice guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to get you going.

* [Python guides](http://newportdataproject.org/tutorials/python/)



## Contributing

If you want to see something added, or if a particular guide doesn't work quite the way it's supposed to, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/NewportDataProject/tutorials/issues/new). 

_Better yet,_ clone the [tutorials repository](https://github.com/NewportDataProject/tutorials) and add a tutorial that covers something new!
