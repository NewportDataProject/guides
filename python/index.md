# Python

This guide will get you up and running with the Python scripting language. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)):

> Python is a widely used [high-level programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language) for [general-purpose programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language), created by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) and first released in 1991. An [interpreted language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language), Python has a design philosophy which emphasizes code [readability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability) (notably using [whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character) indentation to delimit [code blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_block) rather than curly braces or keywords), and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer [lines of code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code) than possible in languages such as [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) or [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)). The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.  

This guide represents Paul's view of Python; it is by no means the only way to configure your workflow, but this is what's worked for him so far.

## Get it

Paul's favorite python distribution is [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview). It's nice because it installs a lot of handy packages  alongside python, and has a powerful environment manager ([more on that](https://conda.io/docs/intro.html)).

1. [Download Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and install it. If you don't know which version to install, install the Python 3.x version. The default installation is pretty straightforward, but if you want more details, check out the [documentation](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install).
2. (Optional, but recommended) [Download and install Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/), an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python.  See the [getting started guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2017.1/quick-start-guide.html) for configuration instructions.
